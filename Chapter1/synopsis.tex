\section[Methodology]{\textbf{Methodology}}
% Discuss about the methodology you identified to execute the objectives of your project in brief. Methodology is a system of practices, techniques, procedures, and rules used to execute a particular project. You can elaborate the methodology in a later chapter. Here you can present in the form of a flow diagram and explain the methodology in a paragraph.
The steps adopted during the implementation of the Budget Planning Application can
be shown as a three stage pipeline as discussed below :

\begin{itemize}
\item Use of SAP UI5 and SAP Fiori for the deployment of the front-end system. A glimpse
 of the Fiori LaunchPad is shown in the diagram below. It shows the catalogue
 containing a suite of applications customized according to user preferences and
 packages.

\end{figure}
    
\item Setting up SAP S/4 HANA databases for collecting and capturing info received
    through the programs. The database can analyze significant volume actual statistics
    in a brief period.
\item Server-side code on the backend built upon SAP ABAP.
\item  To get an expedient solution for data representation, Core Data Services Views are
    supported by the current relational databases and views.
\item  SAP NetWeaver Gateway Client and Open data Protocol are used toh link
    backend with frontend resources.
\end{itemize}

%     The figure above shows a high level framework of the different tiers and the connection
%     amongst all components. The Odata and Netweaver Gateway are mainly used for the
%     interlinking of front-end and backend services.


%     The features to be provided include-

%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Budget requests, reviews and adoption- Manage budgets in a single application
