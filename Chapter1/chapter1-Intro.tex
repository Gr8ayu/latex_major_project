\chapter{Introduction}

\section[Introduction]{\textbf{Introduction}}
As society grows more complex, government faces a challenge and an opportunity. 
The challenge is to deliver on its mission to provide, protect, and prosper in 
an increasingly multifaceted society where it is difficult to develop one-size-fits-all 
programs that meet the precise needs of citizens

To deliver improved services to citizens,
governments at every level are faced with similar
set of challenges. One example is how to harness
the big data which has been acquired through
various touch points and other sources in order
to deliver impactful and relevant services along
with generating meaningful insights for intelligent
decision making.

As government delivers on its timeless mission to
provide for its citizens, protect them, and help
them prosper, it delivers services across a value
chain. That begins with reform, moves through
operations, delivers a service, measures
outcomes, and then begins again.

By adopting an artificial intelligence and machine
learning aligned data-driven strategy,
government can see the benefits of digital
transformation. Such a transformation can help
you to design innovative new business models. 
across multiple channels, optimize processes,
engage citizens and partners more effectively,
and manage change successfully. Armed with
360-degree insight, real-time recommendations,
and greater agility, you can better see the root
cause of problems, look for viable solutions, and
deploy them quickly. It can also help you to
report critical outcomes internally and externally,
reduce improper payments, and develop more
meaningful and impactful public policy. In short,
the transformation can help you function more
efficiently while increasing public trust and
support.

\section[Motivation]{\textbf{Motivation}}
The methods that government typically uses to
evaluate policies and outcomes may no longer be
sufficient to calibrate needed programs. As
complexity rises, the world is becoming more
interdisciplinary - problems can and do have
multiple root causes. The inability to approach
these root causes from multiple perspectives can
limit the efficacy of government action to solve
them.

However, most governments are not similarly managing
their data as a strategic asset to solve citizen problems,
meet citizen needs, and better understand the
consequences of potential new policies. Government
organizations still largely consider money, people,
facilities, and systems (not necessarily data) as their chief
assets. Very often data is perceived more as a problem
than a strategic asset.

\section[Problem statement]{\textbf{Problem statement}}

The core mission of the public sector – to protect the community, provide services,
and help the economy prosper – remains firmly in place. For public organizations,
success is measured not only by financial return on investment but even more so by
political and social return. Changes in technologies, citizen expectations, operational
models, and standards themselves require constant adaptation. Public sector
organizations must be able to respond to rapidly changing conditions and continue to
deliver outcomes within budget, yet still comply with standards

Designed to help all levels of government maximize public value, SAP for Public Sector solutions enable governments to optimize limited resources in public administration while delivering responsive front-office services. Our solutions support business processes across a wide range of government functions, from accounting and procurement to case management and social services.

SAP solutions help governments leverage their finite time, money, and personnel resources to fulfill mandated program and service requirements on a timely basis. Where two or more agencies share responsibility for a common outcome, these solutions can integrate information, processes, and technology to support the active collaboration that delivers financial returns, as well as social and political results, to internal and external government stakeholders. 

\section[Objectives]{\textbf{Objectives}}
This digital age is disruptive. Public sector organizations need strategic priorities that drive transformation. SAP envisions reimagined end-to-end (E2E)
business scenarios to support the strategic priorities of the digital economy.

The objectives of the project are
\begin{enumerate}
\item Put the citizen at the center

Continue your journey by further simplifying complicated
processes for the citizen, providing personalized, self-managed,
secure online engagement. Deliver the best customer experience
by connecting the front office to the back office. Become
anticipatory service orchestrators, information brokers, and
networkers.
\item Reimagine business processes and models

Lay a digital foundation for more efficient and agile processes,
to be able to quickly change when unforeseen disruptions
occur. Proactively adapt operational models and augment
everyday tasks so government workers can focus on the cases
that require human engagement.

\item Leverage data as an asset

Create a culture that is open and transparent – one that values
evidence over intuition and is based on an organization-wide
“single source of truth” that integrates interorganizational and
external data. Prioritize protection of data and privacy. Improve
services to citizens by adopting a data-driven strategy that
enables action from insight.

\item Enable the workforce of the future

Give employees every opportunity to do and be their best. Align
employee skills with organization needs, reduce compliance risk,
and keep remote workers engaged and productive. Track and
manage employee health and assess workforce engagement
and well-being. Understand potential implications for culture,
productivity, and the organization overall
\end{enumerate}

\section[Literature Review]{\textbf{Literature Review}}

% A literature review is a text of a scholarly paper, which includes the current knowledge including substantive findings, as well as theoretical and methodological contributions to a particular topic. Literature reviews are secondary sources, and do not report new or original experimental work. Most often associated with academic-oriented literature, such reviews are found in academic journals, and are not to be confused with book reviews that may also appear in the same publication. Literature reviews are a basis for research in nearly every academic field . A narrow-scope literature review may be included as part of a peer-reviewed journal article presenting new research, serving to situate the current study within the body of the relevant literature and to provide context for the reader. In such a case, the review usually precedes the methodology and results sections of the work.

\subsection{ERP Systems in Public Sector}

The vast majority of ERP system implementation in
production systems has been completed and consequently
the needs of that market have been satisfied. Some other
potential areas of ERP systems implementation were in
focus of ERP systems manufacturers. One of the emerging
markets is the public sector. Implementation of ERP
systems in the public sector has already began regardless
of some well-known ERP implementation problems such
as enormous investment and risk of failure in
implementation itself. Numerous published scientific
papers deal with various aspects of ERP systems, but the
number of papers regarding ERP systems implementation
in the public sector is relatively small. That particular area
of the public sector is becoming increasingly interesting for
ERP systems manufacturers, and researchers are interested
in the areas of public services where the ERP systems have
already been implemented. \cite*[]{Robert2014}

Following are the feilds where the ERP system can be systematically incorporated in Public sector

% \subsubsection[Review types]{\textbf{Review types}}

% The main types of literature reviews are: evaluative, exploratory, and instrumental. A fourth type, the systematic review, is often classified separately, but is essentially a literature review focused on a research question, trying to identify, appraise, select and synthesize all high-quality research evidence and arguments relevant to that question. A meta-analysis is typically a systematic review using statistical methods to effectively combine the data used on all selected studies to produce a more reliable result.


% \subsubsection[Process and product]{\textbf{Process and product}}

% Distinguish between the process of reviewing the literature and a finished work or product known as a literature review. The process of reviewing the literature is often ongoing and informs many aspects of the empirical research project. All of the latest literature should inform a research project. Scholars need to be scanning the literature long after a formal literature review product appears to be completed.

% \subsubsection{\textbf{Page limitation}}

% A careful literature review is usually 15 to 30 pages and could be longer. The process of reviewing the literature requires different kinds of activities and ways of thinking and link the activities of doing a literature review with Benjamin Bloom’s revised taxonomy of the cognitive domain (ways of thinking: remembering, understanding, applying, analysing, evaluating, and creating).

% This section should contain the review of the literature in the past.You should review a minimum of 10 papers from standard reference journals. Kindly avoid local conference papers and papers from predatory journals. Kindly consult with your guide and finalize papers to be considered for review before adding in this section.Report the major observations and findings from each paper in one paragraph in the format given below.

%  proposed various techniques for adders and multipliers.Add the reference papers to the bibliography section using Jabref and cite it here using the instructions given in further chapters.


% \subsubsection{\textbf{Plagiarism}}

% To use someone else's exact words without quotation marks and appropriate credit, or to use the unique ideas of someone else without acknowledgement, is known as plagiarism. In publishing, plagiarism is illegal; in other circumstances, it is, at the least, unethical. You may quote or paraphrase the words or ideas of another if you document your source. Although you need not enclose the paraphrased material in quotation marks, you must document the source. 

% Paraphrased ideas are taken from someone else whether or not the words are identical. Paraphrasing a passage without citing the source is permissible only when the information paraphrased is common knowledge in a field. (Common knowledge refers to historical, scientific, geographical, technical, and other type of information on a topic readily available in handbooks, manuals, atlases and other references). 

% \subsubsection{How to add Reference}
% Use \texttt{Jabref} which will help in adding the reference in a separate file, from which one can use \verb|\citep\{\}| command to add reference. A sample, referring to a textbook would look something like this,\cite{Razavi2000}.
